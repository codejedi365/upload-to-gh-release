# Python Semantic Release - Upload to GitHub Release Action

> **DEPRECATION NOTICE:** This action has been deprecated as it has been renamed to

Full documentation is available in the
[documentation](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for Python
Semantic Release.

> **WARNING**: This Action is intended to be used in conjunction with Python
> Semantic Release configuration of the same version! Using this Action with
